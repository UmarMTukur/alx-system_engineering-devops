Impact: A major outage was experienced by the customers of my online platform during the specified duration. The platform's authentication system was down and users were unable to log into their accounts. Approximately 95% of the platform's users were affected by the outage.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a database server failure. The database server was overwhelmed by a sudden increase in the number of authentication requests, causing it to crash.
Timeline:
23rd January 2021, 22:15 UTC: The issue was detected when the first customer complaint was received. 23rd January 2021, 22:20 UTC: The incident was escalated to the operations team who started investigating the issue. 23rd January 2021, 22:30 UTC: The operations team assumed the issue was with the load balancer and started to investigate it. 23rd January 2021, 22:45 UTC: The investigation revealed that the issue was not with the load balancer and the team shifted their focus to the database server. 23rd January 2021, 23:15 UTC: The root cause of the issue was discovered to be a database server failure. 24th January 2021, 00:15 UTC: The database server was restarted and the authentication system was restored. 24th January 2021, 01:00 UTC: The incident was resolved and the platform was fully operational again.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was a database server failure. The database server was unable to handle the sudden increase in the number of authentication requests, causing it to crash. The issue was resolved by restarting the database server, which restored the authentication system. Corrective and Preventative Measures: The following corrective and preventative measures will be implemented to avoid similar outages in the future: Upgrade the database server to handle increased traffic. Implement automatic failover mechanisms to ensure continuous availability in case of similar failures. Monitor the authentication system more closely and implement alerts for sudden spikes in traffic. Perform regular maintenance and testing of the authentication system to ensure its stability. These measures will help us to ensure the stability and reliability of the platform's authentication system, preventing similar outages from happening in the future.
